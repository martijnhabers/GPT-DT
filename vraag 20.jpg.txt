        Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
        
        Letter:B

Reasoning: 
Based on the given context, there are no immediate hazards that require braking (option A). However, since there is a pedestrian crossing sign and a person 23.0 meters directly in front of you, it is important to reduce speed and be prepared to stop if necessary. Letting go of the accelerator (option B) allows for a smoother and safer approach to the pedestrian crossing. Additionally, since there are no significant objects behind you, there is no need to accelerate. The "Keep right" traffic sign also indicates that you should stay in the right lane unless passing another vehicle.
