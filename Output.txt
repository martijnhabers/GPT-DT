Show me just your answer.Consider the following:
            
A) Brake (drastically reducing speed for urgent danger)
When you’re driving the maximum allowed speed, you usually should brake if you encounter:
Weaker road users, like children or pedestrians
There is oncoming traffic on narrow roads
You’re driving past road work or other obstacles
You’re on a chaotic or dangerous intersection
You’re in a busy residential area, or near a school
You’re nearing a sharp or dangerous turn
Large speed differences between you and other road users
For yellow and red traffic lights

B) Let go of the gas pedal (reducing some speed)
When you don’t have a full overview of the situation
When there is no danger
If the speed limit changes

C) Do Nothing (continue driving your current speed)
If there is no direct danger
If there is a proper amount of distance between you and other road users
If you’re driving on a straight road with no traffic lights, signs, or pedestrians
