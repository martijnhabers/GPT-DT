Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a residential area at 35 km/h. The weather condition is sunny weather. This is your front view; You see the following cars: A car 56.0 meters directly infront of you, A car 51.0 meters directly infront of you. You see the following traffic signs: A "Pedestrian crossing" traffic sign, A "Bicycle lane" traffic sign, A "Keep right" traffic sign. You see the following traffic lights: There are no traffic lights in sight. You see the following pedestrians: A person 23.0 meters directly infront of you. You see the following bicyclist: There are no bicycles in sight. Additionally, you see: there are no more objects than the ones mentioned above. This is your rear view: You see the following: There are no significant objects behind you. These are your possible answers: 'A)Brake ', 'B) Let go of the gas pedal' or 'C) Do nothing'. Show me all possible answers as a list. Then, choose one of them. Show me your choice and give a thorough reasoning on why you chose this Consider the following:
            
A) Brake (drastically reducing speed for urgent danger)
When you’re driving the maximum allowed speed, you usually should brake if you encounter:
Weaker road users, like children or pedestrians
There is oncoming traffic on narrow roads
You’re driving past road work or other obstacles
You’re on a chaotic or dangerous intersection
You’re in a busy residential area, or near a school
You’re nearing a sharp or dangerous turn
Large speed differences between you and other road users
For yellow and red traffic lights

B) Let go of the gas pedal (reducing some speed)
When you don’t have a full overview of the situation
When there is no danger
If the speed limit changes

C) Do Nothing (continue driving your current speed)
If there is no direct danger
If there is a proper amount of distance between you and other road users
If you are sure that you can drive safely with the speed you are currently driving

My choice: B) Let go of the gas pedal.
I choose this option because there is no direct danger and I can reduce my speed without drastically slowing down. This will allow me to maintain a safe distance between me and the other cars and pedestrians, while still being able to drive at a reasonable speed. Additionally, this option also allows me to be aware of any changes in the speed limit that may occur.
