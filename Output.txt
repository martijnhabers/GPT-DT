Question: Given the situation, what should you do?

A. Let go of the gas pedal
B. Brake
C. Do nothing

Answer: B. Brake.

Reason: With two cars distanced left and one car approaching from too close straightly in front, it is important to be cautious and reduce your speed. Braking is the best option in this situation as it will help maintain a safe distance between you and the other cars and ensure that you don't have an accident. Additionally, since there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, pedestrians, or bicyclists in sight, there is no need to take any other action.
