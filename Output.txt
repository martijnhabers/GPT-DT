Answer: Brake.

Reason: In this situation, it is important to be aware of your surroundings and to be prepared to react quickly. Braking is the best option because it will allow you to slow down and give you more time to assess the situation. Additionally, braking will help you maintain a safe distance between you and the other vehicles on the road. This will help you avoid any potential collisions and ensure your safety.
