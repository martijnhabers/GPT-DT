Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a residential road at 30 km/h. The weather condition is snowy weather. This is your front view; You see the following cars: A car 31.0 meters infront of you and to your left, A car 16.0 meters infront of you and to your right. You see the following traffic signs: There are no traffic signs in sight. You see the following traffic lights: There are no traffic lights in sight. You see the following pedestrians: A person 17.0 meters infront of you and to your right, A person 17.0 meters infront of you and to your right, A person 17.0 meters infront of you and to your right, A person 15.0 meters directly infront of you, A person 16.0 meters infront of you and to your right, A person 13.0 meters infront of you and to your right. You see the following bicyclist: There are no bicycles in sight. Additionally, you see: there are no more objects than the ones mentioned above. 

Given the described situation above, what would you do: "A) Brake", "B) Let go of the gas pedal" or "C) Do nothing". 
        Consider the following:
        
        A) Brake = drastically reducing speed for urgent danger.
            -When you’re driving the maximum allowed speed, you usually should brake if you encounter:
                -Weaker road users, like children or pedestrians.
                -There is oncoming traffic on narrow roads.
                -You’re driving past road work or other obstacles.
                -You’re on a chaotic or dangerous intersection.
                -You’re in a busy residential area, or near a school.
                -You’re nearing a sharp or dangerous turn.
                -Large speed differences between you and other road users.
                -For yellow and red traffic lights.
        
        B) Let go of the gas pedal = reducing some speed.
            -If the speed limit changes.
        
        C) Do Nothing = continue driving your current speed.
            -If there is no direct danger.
            -I'm already driving at a safe and appropriate speed for the road and weather conditions.
            -All the cars around me are maintaining a safe distance and not making any sudden moves.
            -There are no pedestrians, bicyclists, or other obstacles in my path that require me to slow down or change lanes.
            -There are no traffic signs or lights indicating that I need to take any specific action

        
        Show me all possible answers in the following format:
            A)...
            B)...
            C)...
        Then, choose one of them. Show me your choice and give a thorough reasoning on why you chose this. Use the following format:
            Answer: ...
            Reasoning: ...

Also keep in mind that the speedlimit for trucks and busses on the highway is 80km/h and that highways in the netherlands have multiple lanes so vehicles to the left and right are likely to be on another lane. 
    Answer:
A) Brake
B) Let go of the gas pedal
C) Do nothing

Reasoning: 
Given the snowy weather conditions and the presence of pedestrians in close proximity, it is important to maintain a safe speed and distance. Therefore, option B) Let go of the gas pedal seems appropriate as it allows for a reduction in speed without the need for sudden braking. Additionally, the absence of traffic signs or lights indicates that there are no immediate dangers that require urgent action.
