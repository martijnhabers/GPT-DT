Question: What should you do when you see the cars and other vehicles listed above while driving at 720 km/h in The Netherlands?

Answer: Brake. 

Reason: Even though there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, pedestrians, or bicyclists in sight, it is important to stay aware of the other cars and vehicles on the road. At 720 km/h, it is easy to lose control of the car and cause an accident. Therefore, it is important to brake and reduce your speed to a safe level before attempting to pass any of the vehicles.
