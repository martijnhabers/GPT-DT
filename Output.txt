Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a highway at 70 km/h. The weather condition is overcast weather. This is your front view; You see the following cars: A car approaching from 44.0 meters infront of you and to your left, A car 49.0 meters directly infront of you, A car approaching from 27.0 meters infront of you and to your left, A car 55.0 meters directly infront of you. You see the following traffic signs: A "Roundabout mandatory" traffic sign, A "Speed limit (70km/h)" traffic sign. You see the following traffic lights: There are no traffic lights in sight. You see the following pedestrians: There are no pedestrians in sight. You see the following bicyclist: There are no bicycles in sight. Additionally, you see: there are no more objects than the ones mentioned above. This is your rear view: You see the following: There are no significant objects behind you. These are your possible answers: 'A) Brake ', 'B) Let go of the gas pedal' or 'C) Do nothing'. Show me all possible answers as a list. Then, choose one of them. Show me your choice and give a thorough reasoning on why you chose this Consider the following:
            
A) Brake (drastically reducing speed for urgent danger)
When you’re driving the maximum allowed speed, you usually should brake if you encounter:
Weaker road users, like children or pedestrians
There is oncoming traffic on narrow roads
You’re driving past road work or other obstacles
You’re on a chaotic or dangerous intersection
You’re in a busy residential area, or near a school
You’re nearing a sharp or dangerous turn
Large speed differences between you and other road users
For yellow and red traffic lights

B) Let go of the gas pedal (reducing some speed)
When you don’t have a full overview of the situation
When there is no danger
If the speed limit changes

C) Do Nothing (continue driving your current speed)
If there is no direct danger
If there is a proper amount of distance between you and other road users
If you are aware of the speed limit and you are driving within it

My choice: B) Let go of the gas pedal (reducing some speed)
I chose this option because the conditions do not indicate any direct danger, such as pedestrians, obstacles, or sharp turns. There are also no traffic lights and the speed limit is the same as the one you're currently driving at. Therefore, it is safe to reduce some speed in order to maintain a proper distance between you and other road users.
