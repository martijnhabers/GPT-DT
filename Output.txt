Possible Answers: A) Let go of the gas pedal, B) Brake, C) Do nothing

My Choice: B) Brake. Reasoning: Driving on a motorway at 100 km/h in overcast weather conditions can be dangerous and can lead to an accident. Therefore, it is important to be cautious and reduce the speed of the car. Braking is the best option in this scenario as it will help to slow down the car and reduce the chances of an accident.
