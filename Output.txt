Given the situation, I would choose to 'Let go of the gas pedal'. The reason behind this is that I am driving in a motorway at 10 km/h, which is well below the speed limit. Additionally, there are no traffic signs, lights or pedestrians in sight, which means that I need to be extra cautious and alert. By letting go of the gas pedal, I can reduce my speed and be prepared to stop if necessary. This will help me to stay safe and avoid any potential collisions.
