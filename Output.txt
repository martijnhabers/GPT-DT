Question: What should you do when you see bicycles close to your car on either side while driving in The Netherlands at 25 km/h?

A. Let go of the gas pedal
B. Brake
C. Do nothing

Answer: B. Brake.

Reason: In The Netherlands, bicyclists have the right of way and you must be extra cautious when driving near them. Driving 25 km/h in a residential area is already a low speed, so it is important to brake when you see bicyclists close to your car on either side. This will ensure that you maintain a safe distance and give the bicyclists enough time to react if necessary.
