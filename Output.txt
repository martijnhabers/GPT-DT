Question: What should you do when driving in a motorway area in The Netherlands at 25 km/h and you see two cars approaching from close left and two bicycles straight ahead at a distant?

A) Let go of the gas pedal
B) Brake
C) Do nothing

Answer: B) Brake. As you are driving in a motorway area and you see two cars approaching from close left and two bicycles straight ahead at a distant, it is important to slow down and brake in order to maintain a safe distance and avoid any potential collisions. Additionally, since there are no traffic signs or traffic lights in sight, you should use caution and reduce your speed as necessary.
