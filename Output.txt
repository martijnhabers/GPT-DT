Answer: Brake.

The reason for this is because you are approaching a pedestrian crossing sign, which indicates that there may be pedestrians crossing the road ahead. Even though you don't see any pedestrians in sight, it is still important to be cautious and reduce your speed to ensure that you are able to stop if any pedestrians do appear. By reducing your speed to a safe level, you will be able to react quickly and safely if any pedestrians do appear.
