        Given the described situation above, what would you do: "A) Brake", "B) Let go of the gas pedal" or "C) Do nothing". 
        Consider the following:
        
        A) Brake = drastically reducing speed for urgent danger.
            -When you’re driving the maximum allowed speed, you usually should brake if you encounter:
                -Weaker road users, like children or pedestrians.
                -There is oncoming traffic on narrow roads.
                -You’re driving past road work or other obstacles.
                -You’re on a chaotic or dangerous intersection.
                -You’re in a busy residential area, or near a school.
                -You’re nearing a sharp or dangerous turn.
                -Large speed differences between you and other road users.
                -For yellow and red traffic lights.
        
        B) Let go of the gas pedal = reducing some speed.
            -When you don’t have a full overview of the situation.
            -When there is no danger.
            -If the speed limit changes.
        
        C) Do Nothing = continue driving your current speed.
            -If there is no direct danger.
            -If there is a proper amount of distance between you and other road users.

            Reasoning: ...

Answer: B) Let go of the gas pedal
Reasoning: The weather condition is rainy, so it is important to reduce speed in order to maintain control of the vehicle and increase safety. There are no traffic lights in sight, and the cars ahead of me are not too close. Therefore, it is safe to reduce some speed by letting go of the gas pedal.
