Pick the letter of the answer you chose. Give your thorough reasoning behind your choice.

Answer: A) Let go of the gas pedal.

Reasoning: In a residential area, the speed limit is typically 25 km/h. Since there are no cars, traffic signs, traffic lights, pedestrians, or bicyclists in sight, it is safe to assume that there is no need to slow down or stop. Therefore, the best course of action would be to let go of the gas pedal and maintain the 25 km/h speed limit.
