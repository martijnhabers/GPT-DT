Reasoning: 
Based on the given context, there are no visible objects that require the driver to take any action. The road is clear, and there are no traffic signs, traffic lights, pedestrians, or bicyclists in sight. Therefore, the driver can continue driving at the current speed of 40 km/h without any need to brake or let go of the accelerator. The weather condition is overcast, which may require the driver to be more cautious and attentive, but it does not require any immediate action. The rear view also indicates that there are no significant objects behind the driver, which further confirms that there is no need to take any action at this moment.
