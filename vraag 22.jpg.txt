Context:
            
"""
Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a residential road at 40 km/h. The weather condition is overcast weather.
This is your front view:  """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: B

Reasoning: 
As per the given context, you are driving in a residential road at 40 km/h, which is within the speed limit of 50 km/h for residential areas in The Netherlands. However, the weather condition is overcast, which means the road surface may be wet, and there may be reduced visibility. Therefore, it is advisable to let go of the accelerator and reduce the speed to ensure safe driving. Braking suddenly may cause skidding on the wet road surface, which can be dangerous. Hence, letting go of the accelerator is the best option in this scenario.
