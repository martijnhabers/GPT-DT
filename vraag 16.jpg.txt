        Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
        
        Letter:A) Brake

Reasoning:
- The road conditions are not ideal due to the "Bumpy road" and "Slippery road" traffic signs, which means that sudden braking may be necessary.
- The "No entry" traffic sign indicates that you should not enter a certain area, but it does not affect your current driving situation.
- The "Speed limit (30km/h)" traffic sign does not apply to your current speed of 60 km/h.
- The "Road narrows on the right" traffic sign indicates that the road will become narrower on the right side, but it does not affect your current driving situation.
- The car closely behind you in the rear view means that you should be cautious and ready to brake in case the car behind you suddenly stops or slows down.
