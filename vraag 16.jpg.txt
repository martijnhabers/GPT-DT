Context:
            
"""
Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a county road at 60 km/h. The weather condition is overcast weather.
This is your front view: You see the following traffic signs: A "Bumpy road" traffic sign, A "Slippery road" traffic sign, A "No entry" traffic sign, A "Speed limit (30km/h)" traffic sign, A "Road narrows on the right" traffic sign. This is your rear view: You see the following: A car closely behind you.  """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: B

Reasoning:
Based on the given context, it is important to reduce speed and be cautious due to the presence of the "Bumpy road" and "Slippery road" traffic signs. Additionally, the "Speed limit (30km/h)" traffic sign indicates that the speed limit has been reduced, so it is important to slow down. The "No entry" traffic sign and "Road narrows on the right" traffic sign do not directly affect the current driving situation. However, it is important to be aware of these signs and adjust driving accordingly. As there is a car closely behind, it is important to brake gradually and let go of the accelerator to reduce speed safely and avoid a collision.
