        Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
        
        Letter:B

Reasoning: 
In this scenario, you are driving in an urban road at 30 km/h with rainy weather. You see several cars in front of you, and there are no traffic signs or lights in sight. You should let go of the accelerator and reduce your speed to maintain a safe distance from the cars in front of you. The recommended safe distance in rainy weather is at least 2 seconds behind the vehicle in front of you. By letting go of the accelerator, you can slow down and maintain a safe distance from the other cars on the road. Additionally, you should be prepared to brake if necessary, especially if any of the cars in front of you suddenly stop or slow down.
