Context:
            
"""
Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a highway at 60 km/h. The weather condition is foggy weather.
This is your front view: You see the following cars: A car 32.0 meters directly infront of you, A bus 32.0 meters directly infront of you. """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
In the given context, the visibility is low due to foggy weather. As per Dutch traffic rules, the driver should maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of them. The safe distance is calculated based on the speed of the vehicle and the weather conditions. In this case, the distance between the car and the bus in front of the driver is only 32.0 meters, which is not a safe distance to maintain at a speed of 60 km/h in foggy weather. Therefore, the driver should apply the brakes to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles in front of them.
