        Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
        
        Letter:B

Reasoning: 
In this scenario, there are no significant objects in front of or behind the car, and there are no traffic signs or lights in sight. However, the weather condition is rainy, which means the road is wet and slippery. Therefore, it is safer to let go of the accelerator and reduce the speed of the car to adjust to the weather condition. Braking suddenly can cause the car to skid on the wet road, which can be dangerous. Therefore, the best option is to let go of the accelerator and reduce the speed of the car gradually.
