Choose to either A) Brake B) Let go of the accelerator or C) Do nothing based on the given context.
Context:
            
"""
Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a highway at 100 km/h. The weather condition is rainy weather.
This is your front view: You see the following cars: A car 52.0 meters directly infront of you. """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning: 
In The Netherlands, the minimum safe following distance on a highway is 2 seconds. At a speed of 100 km/h, this translates to a distance of approximately 55 meters. However, in rainy weather, the stopping distance increases due to reduced visibility and decreased tire traction. Therefore, it is important to increase the following distance to at least 3 seconds or more. In this scenario, the car in front is only 52 meters away, which is less than the minimum safe following distance even in ideal weather conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to brake to increase the following distance and maintain a safe driving distance.
