        Letter:B

Reasoning: 
Based on the given context, there are several cars in front of you, some of which are approaching. It is important to maintain a safe distance from the cars in front of you to avoid any potential collisions. As there are no traffic signs or lights in sight, it is important to be cautious and aware of your surroundings. Since you are driving at a speed of 30 km/h, it is safe to let go of the accelerator and slow down to maintain a safe distance from the cars in front of you. Additionally, the weather condition is overcast, which may affect visibility, so it is important to be extra cautious and alert. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Let go of the accelerator.
