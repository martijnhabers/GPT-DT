Context:
            
"""
Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a urban road at 35 km/h. The weather condition is rainy weather.
This is your front view: Additionally, you see: A digital traffic sign 35.0 meters directly infront of you .  """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
In the given context, the driver is driving in an urban road at 35 km/h with rainy weather conditions. The digital traffic sign 35.0 meters directly in front of the driver indicates that the speed limit is 35 km/h. Therefore, the driver should brake to reduce the speed of the vehicle to match the speed limit indicated on the traffic sign. This is important for the safety of the driver and other road users. Additionally, driving at a speed higher than the speed limit can result in a fine.
