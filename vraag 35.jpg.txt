Reasoning: 
Based on the given context, there are no immediate hazards or obstacles in sight. The driver is driving at the appropriate speed limit of 35 km/h and there are no traffic signs or lights indicating a need to slow down or stop. However, there is a digital traffic sign 35.0 meters directly in front of the driver, which may indicate a change in speed limit or a warning of a potential hazard ahead. Therefore, the driver should maintain their current speed and be prepared to adjust their speed accordingly based on the information provided by the digital traffic sign. As there are no immediate hazards or obstacles in sight, there is no need to brake or let go of the accelerator at this time.
