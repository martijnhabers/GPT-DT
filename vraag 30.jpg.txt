        Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
        
        Letter:A) Brake

Reasoning:
Based on the given context, there are multiple cars approaching from different directions and distances, and there is a car closely behind you. As a driver, it is important to maintain a safe distance from the cars in front of you and to be aware of the cars behind you. Therefore, it is necessary to slow down and brake to maintain a safe distance from the cars in front of you and to allow the car behind you to pass if necessary. Additionally, the speed limit in urban areas in The Netherlands is usually 50 km/h, and you are driving at 45 km/h, so slowing down is not a violation of the speed limit.
