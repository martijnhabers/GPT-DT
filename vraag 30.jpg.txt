Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
Based on the given context, there are several cars approaching from different directions, and there is a car closely behind you. As a driver, it is important to maintain a safe distance from the car in front of you and to be aware of the cars approaching from different directions. Therefore, it is advisable to brake to reduce your speed and maintain a safe distance from the car in front of you. Additionally, braking will also signal to the car behind you that you are slowing down, which will give them time to react and slow down as well.
