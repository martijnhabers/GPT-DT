Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
Based on the given context, there are several factors that suggest the need to brake:

1. The car directly in front of you is only 26.0 meters away, which is a relatively short distance at a speed of 100 km/h.
2. There are several cars in front of you and to your right, which could potentially cause a traffic jam or accident.
3. There is a traffic light ahead, which may turn red and require you to stop.
4. There are digital traffic signs ahead, which may indicate a need to slow down or stop.

Therefore, it is safest to brake in order to maintain a safe distance from the car in front of you and to be prepared for any potential hazards ahead.
