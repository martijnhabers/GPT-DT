        Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
        
        Letter:A) Brake

Reasoning: 
Driving in snowy weather can reduce the grip of the tires on the road, making it harder to stop the car quickly. Additionally, there are multiple pedestrians in front of the car, which increases the risk of an accident. Therefore, it is important to reduce the speed of the car and be prepared to stop quickly if necessary. The car in front of you is also very close, so it is important to maintain a safe following distance. Braking will help to reduce the speed of the car and increase the distance to the car in front of you, reducing the risk of a collision.
