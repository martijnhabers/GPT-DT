Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
Driving in snowy weather can reduce visibility and increase the stopping distance of the vehicle. In this scenario, there are multiple pedestrians in front of the vehicle, some of which are relatively close. As a driver, it is important to maintain a safe distance from pedestrians and be prepared to stop the vehicle if necessary. Therefore, it is recommended to brake the vehicle to ensure the safety of the pedestrians and the driver. Additionally, there are cars in front of the vehicle, which may require sudden braking, so it is better to be cautious and prepared.
