Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A

Reasoning: 
As per the given context, the weather condition is rainy, which means the road surface is wet and slippery. Wet roads reduce the friction between the tires and the road, which increases the stopping distance. Therefore, it is essential to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front and be prepared to brake suddenly if necessary. As you are driving in a residential area, there might be children or pets playing around, and sudden braking can prevent accidents. Hence, it is advisable to brake in this situation.
