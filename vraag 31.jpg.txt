Context:
            
"""
Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a urban road at 35 km/h. The weather condition is overcast weather.
This is your front view: You see the following cars: A car on the adjacent lane approaching from 57.0 meters.You see the following traffic signs: A "Pedestrian crossing" traffic sign.  """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
According to Dutch traffic rules, when approaching a pedestrian crossing, the driver must give priority to pedestrians who are already on the crossing or who are about to enter it. Therefore, it is important to slow down and be prepared to stop if necessary. In this scenario, there is a pedestrian crossing sign, which means that there may be pedestrians crossing or about to cross the road. Additionally, there is a car approaching from the adjacent lane, which may also be slowing down or stopping for the pedestrian crossing. Therefore, it is important to brake to ensure the safety of pedestrians and other drivers. The overcast weather condition may also affect visibility, making it even more important to slow down and be cautious.
