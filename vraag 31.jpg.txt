        Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
        
        Letter:A) Brake

Reasoning:
According to Dutch traffic rules, when approaching a pedestrian crossing, the driver must give priority to pedestrians who are already on the crossing or who are about to enter it. In this scenario, there is a "Pedestrian crossing" traffic sign, which means that there may be pedestrians crossing or about to cross the road. Therefore, it is important to slow down and be prepared to stop if necessary. Additionally, there is a car approaching from directly in front of you, which further increases the need to slow down and be prepared to stop. The overcast weather condition may also affect visibility, making it harder to see pedestrians or other potential hazards. Therefore, it is recommended to brake in this scenario to ensure the safety of all road users.
