Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
Based on the given context, there are multiple cars in close proximity to the driver, which increases the risk of collision. Additionally, the weather condition is rainy, which can affect the road's grip and the driver's visibility. Therefore, it is important to reduce the speed and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles to avoid any potential accidents. As the driver is already driving at 30 km/h, the appropriate action would be to brake to reduce the speed further and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles.
