        Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
        
        Letter:A) Brake

Reasoning: 
Driving in snowy weather can be dangerous as it can reduce visibility and make the road slippery. Additionally, the truck approaching from 17.0 meters directly in front of you can be a potential hazard. Therefore, it is important to reduce your speed and maintain a safe distance from the truck. Braking will help you slow down and maintain a safe distance from the truck.
