        Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
        
        Letter:B

Reasoning: 
Since there are no traffic signs or lights in sight, and no pedestrians or bicycles in sight, the only relevant information is the presence of other vehicles on the road. The car and trucks in front of you are at a safe distance, so there is no need to brake. However, it is always a good idea to reduce speed when driving in overcast weather conditions, so letting go of the accelerator is a safe and appropriate action to take. The digital traffic sign in front of you may display important information, so reducing speed will give you more time to read and react to it.
