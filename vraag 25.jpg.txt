"""
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
- The "Speed limit (100km/h)" traffic sign indicates that the maximum speed limit is 100km/h. As the given context does not specify the current speed of the car, it is important to assume that the car may be driving above the speed limit.
- The presence of a yellow traffic light indicates that the driver should prepare to stop, as the traffic light may turn red soon. 
- The presence of multiple vehicles in front of the car, including a truck, increases the risk of sudden braking or slowing down.
- The overcast weather condition may affect visibility and increase the risk of accidents.
- The digital traffic signs may provide additional information about the road conditions or speed limit changes, which may require the driver to slow down or stop.
- Therefore, it is safer to brake and reduce the speed of the car to avoid potential accidents or traffic violations.
