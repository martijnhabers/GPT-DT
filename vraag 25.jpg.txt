        Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
        
        Letter:B

Reasoning: 
Based on the given context, there are no immediate hazards or obstacles that require sudden braking. However, the presence of a "Speed limit (100km/h)" traffic sign indicates that there is a speed limit in place, and it is important to adhere to it. Therefore, it is appropriate to let go of the accelerator and adjust the speed accordingly to comply with the speed limit. The overcast weather condition may also affect visibility, so it is important to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles in front. The yellow traffic light is not relevant as it is not in the direction of travel. The digital traffic signs may provide additional information, but they are not described in detail, so it is not possible to determine their relevance.
