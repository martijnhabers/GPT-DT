Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
In the given context, the weather condition is foggy which means visibility is reduced. Additionally, there are multiple vehicles in front of you and a car closely behind you. In such a situation, it is important to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you to avoid any collision. Therefore, it is necessary to slow down or brake to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles in front of you. It is also important to be aware of the vehicle behind you and avoid sudden braking to prevent a rear-end collision.
