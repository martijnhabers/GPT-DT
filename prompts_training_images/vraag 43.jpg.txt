Context:
            
"""
Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a county road at 40 km/h. The weather condition is rainy weather.
This is your front view: You see the following cars: A car 66.0 meters infront of you and to your right. """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A

Reasoning:
According to the Dutch traffic rules, drivers must maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle in front of them. The recommended safe following distance is at least 2 seconds. In rainy weather conditions, the stopping distance of a vehicle increases due to reduced visibility and slippery road conditions. Therefore, it is important to increase the following distance to at least 3 seconds. In this scenario, the car is only 66.0 meters in front of you, which is less than the recommended safe following distance. Therefore, it is necessary to brake to increase the following distance and maintain a safe driving distance.
