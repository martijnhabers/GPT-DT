Context:
            
"""
Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a highway at 70 km/h. The weather condition is overcast weather.
This is your front view: You see the following cars: A car on the adjacent lane approaching from 44.0 meters, A car 49.0 meters directly infront of you, A car on the adjacent lane approaching from 27.0 meters, A car 55.0 meters directly infront of you.You see the following traffic signs: A "Roundabout mandatory" traffic sign, A "Speed limit (70km/h)" traffic sign.  """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
- The car directly in front of you is only 49.0 meters away, which is less than the recommended 2-second following distance at 70 km/h.
- The car on the adjacent lane approaching from 44.0 meters and the car 55.0 meters directly in front of you may cause potential hazards if the car in front of you suddenly brakes or swerves.
- The "Roundabout mandatory" traffic sign indicates that there is a roundabout ahead, which requires drivers to slow down and yield to traffic already on the roundabout.
- The overcast weather condition may affect visibility and increase the stopping distance.
- Therefore, it is recommended to brake to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for any potential hazards ahead.
