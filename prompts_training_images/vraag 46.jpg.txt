Choose to either A) Brake B) Let go of the accelerator or C) Do nothing based on the given context.
Context:
            
"""
Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a urban road at 30 km/h. The weather condition is sunny weather.
This is your front view: You see the following cars: A car 5.0 meters infront of you and to your right, A car 6.0 meters infront of you and to your right. """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: B

Reasoning:
Based on the given context, there are two cars in front of you and they are both to your right. Since you are driving in an urban road at 30 km/h, it is important to maintain a safe following distance to avoid collision. Therefore, it is recommended to let go of the accelerator to reduce your speed and maintain a safe following distance. This will also give you more time to react to any unexpected situations that may arise. Braking may not be necessary in this situation as it may cause sudden deceleration and increase the risk of collision.
