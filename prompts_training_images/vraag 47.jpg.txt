Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
According to Dutch traffic rules, the driver should always maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of them. In this scenario, there are multiple vehicles and bicyclists in close proximity to the driver's vehicle. The car that is 2.0 meters in front of the driver's vehicle and to the right is too close for comfort and could potentially cause an accident if the driver needs to make a sudden stop. Therefore, the driver should brake to create a safe distance between their vehicle and the car in front of them. Additionally, the bicyclist approaching from 4.0 meters in front of the driver's vehicle and to the left is also a potential hazard, and braking will give the driver more time to react if necessary.
