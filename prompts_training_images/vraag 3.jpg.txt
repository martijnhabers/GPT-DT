Context:
            
"""
Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a provincial road at 25 km/h. The weather condition is snowy weather.
This is your front view: You see the following cars: A truck on the adjacent lane approaching from 17.0 meters. """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
Driving in snowy weather can be dangerous as it can reduce visibility and make the road slippery. In this scenario, a truck is approaching from the adjacent lane at a distance of 17.0 meters. It is important to maintain a safe distance from the truck to avoid any potential accidents. Therefore, it is advisable to brake to reduce the speed and maintain a safe distance from the truck.
