Choose to either A) Brake B) Let go of the accelerator or C) Do nothing based on the given context.
Context:
            
"""
Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a urban road at 40 km/h. The weather condition is sunny weather.
This is your front view: You see the following cars: A car 37.0 meters infront of you and to your left, A car 49.0 meters infront of you and to your left, A car 30.0 meters directly infront of you, A bus 11.0 meters infront of you and to your right. """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
According to Dutch traffic rules, a driver must maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle in front of them. The recommended safe following distance is at least 2 seconds. At a speed of 40 km/h, this translates to a distance of approximately 22 meters. However, in the given context, the driver is too close to the vehicles in front of them, with the closest being only 11 meters away. Therefore, the driver should brake to increase the distance between their vehicle and the other vehicles, ensuring a safe following distance. Additionally, it is always better to be cautious and avoid any potential accidents.
