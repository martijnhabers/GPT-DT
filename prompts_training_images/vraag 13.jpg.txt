"""
Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a highway at unknown km/h. The weather condition is overcast weather.
This is your front view: You see the following cars: A car 22.0 meters directly infront of you, A truck 18.0 meters infront of you and to your left, A truck 26.0 meters directly infront of you, A truck 50.0 meters infront of you and to your left.Additionally, you see: A digital traffic sign 22.0 meters infront of you and to your left .  """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
According to Dutch traffic rules, drivers are required to maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle in front of them. The recommended safe following distance is at least 2 seconds. In this scenario, there are multiple vehicles in front of the driver, and the distance between them is not specified. Additionally, there is a digital traffic sign in front of the driver, which could indicate a change in speed limit or other important information. Therefore, it is important for the driver to slow down and maintain a safe following distance to avoid any potential collisions or violations of traffic rules. Hence, the appropriate action would be to brake.
