Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
- There are three red traffic lights, which means you must stop your vehicle.
- The speed limit in urban areas is usually 50 km/h, and you are only driving at 15 km/h, so you have plenty of time to stop.
- The overcast weather condition may affect visibility, so it's better to be cautious and brake earlier than usual.
- The presence of other cars around you means that sudden braking may cause a collision, so you should brake gradually and give a signal to warn other drivers. 
- The digital traffic signs may provide additional information, but since we don't know what they say, it's better to prioritize the traffic lights.
