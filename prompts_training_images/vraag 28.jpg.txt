Context:
            
"""
Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a residential road at 30 km/h. The weather condition is overcast weather.
This is your front view: You see the following cars: A bus 19.0 meters infront of you and to your right, A car 57.0 meters directly infront of you, A truck 57.0 meters directly infront of you, A car on the adjacent lane approaching from 57.0 meters. """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
According to Dutch traffic rules, the driver should maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle in front of them. The recommended safe following distance is at least 2 seconds. In this scenario, there are multiple vehicles in front of the driver, and they are all relatively close. Therefore, the driver should brake to increase the distance between their vehicle and the vehicles in front of them to ensure they have enough time to react to any sudden changes in traffic. Additionally, the driver should also be prepared to brake if the car on the adjacent lane decides to change lanes or turn. The overcast weather condition may also affect visibility, making it harder to see the road ahead, so it's important to drive cautiously and be prepared to brake if necessary.
