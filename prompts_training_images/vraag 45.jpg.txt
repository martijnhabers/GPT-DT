Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
Based on the given context, there are several cars and a truck in front of you, which means there is a high chance of traffic congestion. As a responsible driver, it is important to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you to avoid any potential accidents. The recommended safe distance is at least 2 seconds behind the vehicle in front of you. In this case, the distance between your car and the vehicle in front of you is less than 2 seconds, which means you need to slow down or brake to maintain a safe distance. Additionally, the weather condition is overcast, which can affect visibility and increase the stopping distance. Therefore, it is important to be cautious and brake if necessary to avoid any potential accidents.
