Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
- The presence of a "Pedestrian crossing" traffic sign indicates that there may be pedestrians crossing the road ahead, so it is important to be prepared to stop.
- The person 23.0 meters directly in front of you is also a potential hazard that may require sudden braking.
- The "Keep right" traffic sign indicates that you should stay in the right lane, which may limit your ability to swerve around any obstacles that may appear suddenly.
- The presence of multiple vehicles in front of you, including a truck, means that your visibility of the road ahead may be limited, so it is important to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop suddenly if necessary.
- The sunny weather conditions may make it easier to see the road ahead, but it may also cause glare that could make it more difficult to see pedestrians or other hazards.
