Context:
            
"""
Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a residential road at 40 km/h. The weather condition is overcast weather.
This is your front view: You see the following cars: A car 25.0 meters directly infront of you, A car on the adjacent lane approaching from 53.0 meters, A car 40.0 meters infront of you and to your right.You see the following traffic signs: A "Keep right" traffic sign. Additionally, you see: A digital traffic sign 61.0 meters directly infront of you .  """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: B

Reasoning:
Based on the given context, there are no immediate hazards that require braking (option A). However, the car on the adjacent lane approaching from 53.0 meters may require attention and caution. The "Keep right" traffic sign indicates that you should stay on the right side of the road. The digital traffic sign 61.0 meters directly in front of you may display important information, so it is important to pay attention to it. Therefore, the best option is to let go of the accelerator (option B) and maintain a safe speed while keeping an eye on the approaching car and the digital traffic sign.
