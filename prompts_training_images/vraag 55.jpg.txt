This is your front view: You see the following cars: A car 19.0 meters directly infront of you, A car on the adjacent lane approaching from 18.0 meters, A car 10.0 meters infront of you and to your right, A car on the adjacent lane approaching from 35.0 meters, A car on the adjacent lane approaching from 28.0 meters, A car on the adjacent lane approaching from 12.0 meters, A car 16.0 meters infront of you and to your right, A truck 16.0 meters infront of you and to your right. """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
According to Dutch traffic rules, a driver must maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle in front of them. The recommended safe following distance is at least 2 seconds. In this scenario, there are several vehicles in close proximity to the driver, including a car only 10 meters in front of them. Therefore, the driver should brake to increase the distance between their vehicle and the one in front of them. Additionally, the presence of overcast weather may reduce visibility and increase the stopping distance required, making it even more important to maintain a safe following distance.
