Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a highway at 10 km/h. The weather condition is sunny weather.
This is your front view: You see the following cars: A car 23.0 meters directly infront of you, A car 17.0 meters directly infront of you, A truck 12.0 meters infront of you and to your right, A car on the adjacent lane approaching from 24.0 meters, A car on the adjacent lane approaching from 30.0 meters.This is your rear view: You see the following: A car closely behind you, A car closely behind you.  """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
- Driving at 10 km/h on a highway is not allowed, as the minimum speed limit on highways in The Netherlands is 50 km/h.
- There are multiple cars and a truck in front of you, which means that you need to maintain a safe following distance to avoid collision in case of sudden braking or any other unexpected event.
- There are also cars closely behind you, which means that you need to avoid sudden braking to prevent a rear-end collision.
- The fact that the weather condition is sunny does not affect the need to brake, as the need to maintain a safe following distance and avoid collision is always present regardless of the weather condition.
