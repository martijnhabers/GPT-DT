Choose to either A) Brake B) Let go of the accelerator or C) Do nothing based on the given context.
Context:
            
"""
Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a urban road at 50 km/h. The weather condition is sunny weather.
This is your front view: You see the following cars: A car 14.0 meters infront of you and to your left, A truck 9.0 meters infront of you and to your right, A car 54.0 meters directly infront of you, A car 59.0 meters directly infront of you, A car on the adjacent lane approaching from 56.0 meters, A truck 61.0 meters directly infront of you. """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
According to Dutch traffic rules, a driver must maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle in front of them. The recommended safe following distance is at least 2 seconds. At a speed of 50 km/h, this translates to a distance of approximately 28 meters. However, in the given context, the cars and trucks in front of the driver are much closer than this recommended distance. Therefore, the driver should brake to create a safe following distance and avoid a potential collision. Additionally, the presence of multiple vehicles in close proximity increases the risk of sudden stops or changes in direction, making it even more important to maintain a safe following distance.
