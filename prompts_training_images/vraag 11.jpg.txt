Context:
            
"""
Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a highway at 60 km/h. The weather condition is overcast weather.
This is your front view: You see the following cars: A car on the adjacent lane approaching from 20.0 meters. """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
According to Dutch traffic rules, drivers are required to maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle in front of them. The recommended safe following distance is at least 2 seconds. In this scenario, the car on the adjacent lane is approaching from only 20 meters away, which is not enough distance to maintain a safe following distance. Therefore, it is necessary to slow down or brake to create a safe distance between the two vehicles. Additionally, the overcast weather condition may affect visibility, making it even more important to maintain a safe following distance.
