Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a residential road at 30 km/h. The weather condition is overcast weather.
This is your front view: You see the following cars: A car 4.0 meters infront of you and to your left, A car 8.0 meters directly infront of you, A car 3.0 meters infront of you and to your right, A car 5.0 meters infront of you and to your left, A car on the adjacent lane approaching from 10.0 meters. """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
- The car 4.0 meters in front of you and to your left is too close for comfort. If that car suddenly brakes, you might not have enough time to react and avoid a collision. Therefore, it's better to be cautious and brake.
- The car 8.0 meters directly in front of you is not too close, but it's still a good idea to be prepared to brake in case that car suddenly stops or slows down.
- The car 3.0 meters in front of you and to your right is also too close for comfort. If that car suddenly turns right or changes lanes, you might not have enough time to react and avoid a collision. Therefore, it's better to be cautious and brake.
- The car 5.0 meters in front of you and to your left is also too close for comfort. If that car suddenly brakes, you might not have enough time to react and avoid a collision. Therefore, it's better to be cautious and brake.
- The car on the adjacent lane approaching from 10.0 meters is not an immediate threat, but it's still a good idea to be prepared to brake in case that car suddenly changes lanes or swerves into your lane.
