"""
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
According to Dutch traffic rules, drivers are required to maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle in front of them. The recommended safe following distance is at least 2 seconds. In this scenario, there are multiple vehicles in front of the driver, and a car closely behind them. Therefore, the driver should brake to increase the distance between their vehicle and the one in front of them, to ensure they have enough time to react to any sudden changes in traffic. Additionally, the presence of trucks in front of the driver means that their visibility may be limited, making it even more important to maintain a safe following distance.
