Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: B) Let go of the accelerator.

Reasoning:
Based on the given context, there are several cars in front of and around the driver. It is important to maintain a safe distance from the cars in front to avoid collision. The driver is already driving at the speed limit of 50 km/h, so braking suddenly may cause a collision with the car behind. Therefore, the best course of action is to let go of the accelerator and maintain a safe distance from the cars in front. This will also give the driver more time to react to any sudden changes in traffic. Additionally, the overcast weather may affect visibility, so it is important to be extra cautious and alert while driving.
