        Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
        
        Letter:B

Reasoning: 
Based on the given context, there are no immediate hazards that require braking (option A). However, there is a car approaching from 53.0 meters directly in front of you, which means you should reduce your speed to maintain a safe distance. Therefore, letting go of the accelerator (option B) is the appropriate action to take. The "Keep right" traffic sign indicates that you should stay on the right side of the road, which you should already be doing. There are no traffic lights or pedestrians/bicyclists in sight, so there are no additional factors to consider. The digital traffic sign 61.0 meters directly in front of you may provide information about upcoming road conditions, so it's important to pay attention to it while reducing your speed.
