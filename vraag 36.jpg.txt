        Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
        
        Letter:A) Brake

Reasoning: 
There are two red traffic lights in front of you, which means you should stop. Additionally, there are no traffic signs indicating otherwise. The digital traffic signs do not provide any information that would allow you to continue driving. Therefore, you should brake to come to a complete stop before the traffic lights.
