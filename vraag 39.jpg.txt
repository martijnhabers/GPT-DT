Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
Based on the given context, there are several cars in front of and approaching the vehicle from adjacent lanes. It is important to maintain a safe distance from the cars in front and to be aware of the approaching cars from the adjacent lanes. The overcast weather condition may also affect visibility. Therefore, it is recommended to brake to reduce the speed and maintain a safe distance from the cars in front. This will also allow the driver to have more time to react to any sudden changes in the traffic situation.
