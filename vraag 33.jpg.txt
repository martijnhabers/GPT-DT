Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a urban road at 40 km/h. The weather condition is sunny weather.
This is your front view: You see the following cars: A car on the adjacent lane approaching from 6.0 meters.Additionally, you see: A digital traffic sign 5.0 meters infront of you and to your right .  """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
According to Dutch traffic rules, the driver must always be able to stop their vehicle within the distance they can see to be clear. In this scenario, there is a car approaching from the adjacent lane, which means there is a possibility of the car changing lanes or making a turn. Therefore, it is important to slow down and be prepared to stop if necessary. Additionally, there is a digital traffic sign ahead, which may indicate a change in speed limit or other important information. Therefore, it is important to be cautious and reduce speed to be able to react to any changes in the traffic situation.
