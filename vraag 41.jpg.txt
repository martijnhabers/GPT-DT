Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
- The "Traffic signals" traffic sign indicates that there may be traffic lights ahead, which could turn red at any moment. Therefore, it is important to be prepared to stop.
- The "Stop" traffic sign indicates that there is a mandatory stop ahead. Therefore, it is necessary to slow down and be prepared to stop.
- The "Priority road" traffic sign indicates that you are not on a priority road, which means that you should give priority to vehicles coming from the right. Therefore, it is important to be prepared to stop if necessary.
- The car on the adjacent lane approaching from 4.0 meters and the car on the adjacent lane approaching from 4.0 meters are potential hazards, as they may change lanes or turn without warning. Therefore, it is important to be prepared to stop if necessary.
- The truck 5.0 meters directly in front of you is a potential hazard, as it may suddenly brake or turn without warning. Therefore, it is important to be prepared to stop if necessary.
- The person 3.0 meters directly in front of you is a pedestrian, and it is important to be prepared to stop if necessary to avoid hitting them. 
- Overall, there are multiple potential hazards and traffic signs indicating the need to be prepared to stop, which is why the best option is to brake.
