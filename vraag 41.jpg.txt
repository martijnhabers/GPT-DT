        Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
        
        Letter:A) Brake

Reasoning:
- There is a car approaching from 4.0 meters in front of you and to your left, which means there is a risk of collision if you continue driving at the same speed.
- There is a person 3.0 meters directly in front of you, which means you need to be prepared to stop in case the person crosses the road.
- There is a "Stop" traffic sign, which means you need to come to a complete stop at the stop line or before entering the intersection.
- There is a "Traffic signals" traffic sign, which means there may be traffic lights ahead that you need to obey.
- There is a "Priority road" traffic sign, which means you need to give priority to vehicles coming from the right at intersections.
- There are no traffic lights in sight, which means you need to pay extra attention to other traffic signs and signals.
- There are no bicycles in sight, which means you don't need to worry about giving them extra space.
- There are no significant objects behind you, which means you don't need to worry about vehicles approaching from behind.
- Therefore, it is safest to brake and be prepared to stop at the stop line or before entering the intersection, and to give priority to vehicles coming from the right.
