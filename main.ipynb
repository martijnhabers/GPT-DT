You see the following traffic lights: There are no traffic lights in sight. You see the following pedestrians: There are no pedestrians in sight. You see the following bicyclist: There are no bicycles in sight. Additionally, you see: there are no more objects than the ones mentioned above. This is your rear view: You see the following  cars: There are no significant objects behind you.Given the described situation above, what would you do: 'Let go of the gas pedal', 'Brake' or 'Do nothing'.

Even though you don't see any pedestrians in sight, it is still important to be cautious and reduce your speed to ensure that you are able to stop if any pedestrians do appear. By reducing your speed to a safe level, you will be able to react quickly and safely if any pedestrians do appear.\n"
