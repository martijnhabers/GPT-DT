Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
- The car directly in front of you is only 35 meters away, which is less than the recommended 2-second following distance at 40 km/h. Therefore, you should slow down and increase the distance between you and the car in front of you.
- The "Roundabout mandatory" traffic sign indicates that there is a roundabout ahead, which requires you to slow down and yield to traffic already on the roundabout.
- The "Bicycle lane" traffic sign indicates that there is a designated lane for bicycles, which means you should be aware of any bicyclists in the area and give them enough space.
- There are multiple bicyclists in front of you and to your right, which means you should be cautious and give them enough space to maneuver.
- The overcast weather condition may affect visibility, so it's important to be extra cautious and alert.
