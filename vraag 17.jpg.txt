        Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
        
        Letter:A) Brake

Reasoning:
According to Dutch traffic rules, the minimum safe following distance on a highway is 2 seconds. At a speed of 90 km/h, this translates to a distance of approximately 50 meters. However, in the given context, the closest car is only 9 meters in front of you, which is well below the safe following distance. Additionally, the weather condition is rainy, which means that the road surface is slippery and it takes longer to stop the vehicle. Therefore, it is necessary to slow down and increase the distance between your car and the cars in front of you to ensure safe driving. Hence, the correct answer is A) Brake.
