Context:
            
"""
Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a highway at 90 km/h. The weather condition is rainy weather.
This is your front view: You see the following cars: A car 27.0 meters directly infront of you, A car 28.0 meters directly infront of you, A car 9.0 meters infront of you and to your right, A bus 9.0 meters infront of you and to your right. """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
According to Dutch traffic rules, drivers must maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle in front of them. The recommended safe following distance is at least 2 seconds. In rainy weather, the safe following distance should be increased to at least 3 seconds. In this scenario, there are multiple vehicles in front of the driver, and the distance between them is less than the recommended safe following distance. Therefore, the driver should brake to increase the distance between their vehicle and the vehicles in front of them, ensuring a safe following distance.
