Context:
            
"""
Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a urban road at 30 km/h. The weather condition is rainy weather.
This is your front view: You see the following cars: A car 8.0 meters directly infront of you, A car 2.0 meters infront of you and to your left, A car 8.0 meters infront of you and to your left, A car 4.0 meters infront of you and to your left, A car on the adjacent lane approaching from 3.0 meters, A car 3.0 meters infront of you and to your left. """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
According to Dutch traffic rules, a driver must maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle in front of them. The recommended safe following distance is at least 2 seconds. In this scenario, there are multiple cars in front of the driver, and the weather condition is rainy, which means the road is slippery and the braking distance is longer. Therefore, the driver should brake to maintain a safe following distance and avoid a potential collision. Additionally, the car on the adjacent lane approaching from 3.0 meters is too close, and the driver should also slow down to avoid a potential collision.
