        Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
        
        Letter:A) Brake

Reasoning:
- There are multiple cars in front of you, which means you need to maintain a safe distance to avoid collision in case of sudden stops or turns.
- The weather condition is rainy, which means the road is slippery and it takes longer to stop the car.
- The car approaching from 3.0 meters in front of you and to your left is a potential hazard, as it may try to change lanes or turn without signaling.
- Therefore, it is safer to brake and reduce your speed to maintain a safe distance from the cars in front of you and to be prepared for any unexpected situations.
