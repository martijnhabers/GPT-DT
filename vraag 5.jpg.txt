        Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
        
        Letter:A) Brake

Reasoning:
- The road conditions are rainy, which means the road is slippery and it takes longer to stop the car.
- There is a bicyclist directly in front of you, which means you need to keep a safe distance to avoid collision.
- There are multiple cars approaching from the left, which means there is a potential for a collision if any of them suddenly change lanes or stop.
- There is a digital traffic sign 62.0 meters in front of you, which means there may be a change in speed limit or other important information that you need to be prepared for.
- The "Priority road" traffic sign indicates that you have the right of way, but you still need to be cautious and prepared to brake if necessary.
