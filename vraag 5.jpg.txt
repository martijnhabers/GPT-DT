Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
- The weather condition is rainy, which means the road is slippery and it takes longer to stop the car.
- There are several cars approaching from the adjacent lane, which means there is a possibility of them changing lanes or turning, which requires the driver to be prepared to stop.
- There is a bicyclist directly in front of the car, which requires the driver to maintain a safe distance and be prepared to stop if necessary.
- There is a digital traffic sign ahead, which may indicate a change in speed limit or other important information that requires the driver to slow down.
- The "Priority road" traffic sign indicates that the driver has priority over other vehicles, but it does not mean that the driver can ignore other traffic rules or drive recklessly. The driver should still be prepared to stop if necessary.
