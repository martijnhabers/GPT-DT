Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
According to Dutch traffic rules, a driver must maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle in front of them. The recommended safe following distance is at least 2 seconds. In this scenario, there are multiple vehicles and a bicyclist in close proximity to the driver, which increases the risk of a collision. Therefore, the driver should brake to maintain a safe following distance and avoid a potential accident. Additionally, the overcast weather condition may affect visibility, making it even more important to maintain a safe following distance.
