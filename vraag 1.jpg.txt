Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
According to the given context, there are several cars approaching from adjacent lanes at varying distances, a pedestrian and a bicyclist in close proximity. As a driver, it is important to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and to be prepared to stop if necessary. Therefore, it is advisable to brake in this situation to ensure the safety of all road users. Additionally, the speed limit in urban areas in The Netherlands is usually 50 km/h, so driving at 40 km/h is already a cautious approach.
