This is your front view: You see the following pedestrians: A person 17.0 meters infront of you and to your left. Additionally, you see: A motorcycle 17.0 meters infront of you and to your left .  """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
According to Dutch traffic rules, pedestrians always have the right of way. As there is a pedestrian in front of you, you should slow down and be prepared to stop if necessary. Additionally, it is important to maintain a safe distance from the motorcycle in front of you to avoid any potential collisions. Therefore, it is best to brake in this situation to ensure the safety of all road users.
