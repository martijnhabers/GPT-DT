        Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
        
        Letter:A) Brake

Reasoning:
- Driving at 10 km/h on a highway is not allowed, as the minimum speed limit on highways in The Netherlands is 50 km/h.
- There are cars closely behind you, which means you should not slow down abruptly without warning, as this could cause a rear-end collision.
- There are several cars in front of you, which means you should maintain a safe following distance to avoid a collision in case the cars in front of you suddenly brake or slow down.
- There are no traffic signs or traffic lights in sight, which means you should follow the general traffic rules and regulations, including maintaining a safe speed and distance.
- Braking is the safest option in this scenario, as it allows you to slow down gradually and maintain a safe distance from the cars in front of you, while also giving the cars behind you enough time to react and slow down as well.
