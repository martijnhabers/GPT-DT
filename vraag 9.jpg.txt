        Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
        
        Letter:A) Brake

Reasoning:
According to Dutch traffic rules, drivers must maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle in front of them. The recommended safe following distance is at least 2 seconds. However, in rainy weather, this distance should be increased to at least 3 seconds. In this scenario, the driver is following several vehicles at a close distance, which is not safe in rainy weather. Therefore, the driver should brake to increase the following distance and maintain a safe driving distance.
