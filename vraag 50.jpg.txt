Reasoning: 
Based on the given context, there are no traffic signs or lights in sight, and there are no pedestrians or bicycles in sight. The only cars present are in front of you, and there are no significant objects behind you. Therefore, there is no immediate danger or reason to brake. However, there is a car approaching from 10.0 meters directly in front of you, which means you should let go of the accelerator to slow down and prepare to stop if necessary. The overcast weather condition may also affect visibility, so it is important to be cautious and alert.
