        Letter:A) Brake

Reasoning:
Based on the given context, there are no traffic signs or lights in sight, and there are no pedestrians or bicycles in sight. However, there are three vehicles in front of you, with the closest being only 22 meters away. Additionally, there is a car closely behind you. Therefore, it is important to slow down and maintain a safe distance from the vehicles in front of you to avoid a potential collision. Hence, the appropriate action to take in this situation is to brake.
