This is your front view: You see the following cars: A car 23.0 meters infront of you and to your left, A car 14.0 meters infront of you and to your left, A car on the adjacent lane approaching from 55.0 meters, A car on the adjacent lane approaching from 55.0 meters, A car on the adjacent lane approaching from 50.0 meters, A car on the adjacent lane approaching from 62.0 meters. """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
In this scenario, the weather condition is foggy, which means visibility is reduced. There are also several cars approaching from the adjacent lane, which increases the risk of a collision. Therefore, it is important to reduce speed and be prepared to stop if necessary. As the cars in front of you are also relatively close, it is safer to brake to maintain a safe distance. It is always better to be cautious and avoid accidents, especially in conditions where visibility is reduced.
