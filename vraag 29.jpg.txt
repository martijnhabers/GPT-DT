        Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
        
        Letter:B

Reasoning: 
In this scenario, you are driving in a residential road at 30 km/h in rainy weather. There are several cars approaching from different distances directly in front of you. To ensure a safe distance between your car and the cars in front of you, you should let go of the accelerator and reduce your speed. This will give you more time to react to any sudden changes in the traffic situation and avoid collisions. Additionally, reducing your speed will also reduce the risk of hydroplaning on the wet road surface. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Let go of the accelerator.
