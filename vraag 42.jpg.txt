Context:
            
"""
Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a urban road at 30 km/h. The weather condition is overcast weather.
This is your front view: You see the following cars: A car on the adjacent lane approaching from 4.0 meters. """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake.

Reasoning: 
As per the Dutch traffic rules, a driver must maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of them. The recommended safe distance is at least 2 seconds. In this scenario, a car is approaching from the adjacent lane at a distance of 4.0 meters, which is less than the recommended safe distance. Therefore, it is necessary to brake to maintain a safe distance and avoid any potential collision. Additionally, the weather condition is overcast, which may affect visibility, making it even more important to maintain a safe distance.
