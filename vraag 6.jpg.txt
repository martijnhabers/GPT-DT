Context:
            
"""
Assume you are driving in The Netherlands. You are driving in a residential road at 40 km/h. The weather condition is overcast weather.
This is your front view: You see the following cars: A car 16.0 meters infront of you and to your right, A truck 40.0 meters directly infront of you. """
Give your answer in one letter, after which you should provide thorough reasoning.
Letter: A) Brake

Reasoning:
According to Dutch traffic rules, a driver must maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle in front of them. The recommended safe following distance is at least 2 seconds. At a speed of 40 km/h, this translates to a distance of approximately 22 meters. However, in this scenario, the car in front of you is only 16 meters away, which means you are too close to it. Additionally, there is a truck 40 meters in front of you, which could potentially slow down or stop suddenly. Therefore, it is important to brake to create a safe following distance and be prepared for any sudden changes in the traffic situation. The overcast weather condition could also affect visibility, making it even more important to maintain a safe following distance.
