Reasoning: 
Based on the given context, there are no immediate dangers or obstacles that require sudden braking. However, there is a car approaching from the left at 44.0 meters and another car approaching from the left at 27.0 meters. It is important to reduce speed and be prepared to stop if necessary. The "Roundabout mandatory" traffic sign indicates that there is a roundabout ahead, which requires drivers to slow down and yield to traffic already in the roundabout. The "Speed limit (70km/h)" traffic sign indicates that the maximum speed limit is 70 km/h, which is the current speed of the vehicle. Therefore, it is recommended to let go of the accelerator and reduce speed to be prepared for any potential hazards ahead.
